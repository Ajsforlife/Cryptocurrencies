# Cryptocurrencies
Using unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurrencies.

Deliverable 1:

In the first deliverable we are basically merging dataframes and filtering data to further perform analysis on the filtered data frame.

Deliverable 2:

We ran a PCA model with 3 principal components and then merged the data into a dataframe.

We created an elbow curve to find the kmean value which is 4. We then used the predictions to fill in the class column and create a new dataframe which holds all the previous data we filtered and analyzed.

We created a 3d plot of the data and then created a mew dataframe that holds the scaled values for TotalCoinsMined and TotalCoinSupply and merged it with the previous dataframe and then finally created a 2d plot of the TotalCoinsMined and the TotalCoinSupply.
